# React Native Crash on API Data Fetch Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where the app crashes when fetching data from an API fails or returns unexpected data.  The problem lies in the missing null checks before accessing properties of the fetched data.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy component.  When the API request fails or the response is null or undefined, accessing `data.name` and `data.description` throws an error, causing the app to crash.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that includes proper null checks to prevent the crashes.  This ensures the app gracefully handles errors and prevents unexpected termination.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using a React Native simulator or device. 
4. Observe the crash when the API request fails or returns an unexpected response.
5. Compare the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files to see the fix.
